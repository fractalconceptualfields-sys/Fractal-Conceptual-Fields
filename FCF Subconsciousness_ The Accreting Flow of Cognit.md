# FCF Subconsciousness: The Accreting Flow of Cognition

## Introduction

Consciousness research is at an inflection point. While traditional models oscillate between reductive neurophysical accounts and broad panpsychist theories, a persistent mystery remains: What is the subconscious, and how is it to be understood without mystical residue or explanatory dualism? The Fractal Conceptual Fields (FCF) framework redefines the subconscious not as a shadowy realm of repressed or inaccessible states but as the **accreting flow**—the thermodynamically measurable substrate of negative prehensions that continuously co-shapes conscious experience. This approach integrates core advances from process philosophy, thermodynamics (constructal law), experimental psychology, and a firm rejection of the positivist split between mechanism ("how?") and principle ("why?").

## Theoretical Context: From Prehension to Flow

### Negative Prehension in Process Philosophy

Alfred North Whitehead, in *Process and Reality*, defined existence and experience in terms of **prehensions**—relations of felt inclusion or exclusion by which each entity becomes itself through processual differentiation. **Positive prehensions** are those elements actively felt and integrated into a subject's present experience. **Negative prehensions** are definite exclusions—factors present in the environment but actively omitted from the subject's internal constitution, though not from reality itself. This mechanism bypasses the ontological split between perceived and unperceived, treating both as integral to the process of becoming.

### Accreting Flow and Constructal Law

Adrian Bejan's Constructal Law posits that persistence in nature depends upon systems continuously evolving architectures that maximize access to flow—be it heat, fluids, or information. In FCF, Bejan's "interstice" (the diffuse substrate between vigorous flow channels) is reinterpreted as **accreting flow** that provides the "channels" (**vigorous flow**) shaping resistances through differential access. The change of terminology within FCF is a necessary indicator of causal "with" relationship - the two are inseparable as there are no "gaps" in reality.  Every vigorous flow has an accreting flow that is in turn consisting of nested vigorous flows and lower scale accreting flows until we get to the very bottom limit of our current epistemological knowledge.

Thus, the subconscious: the accreting flow of negative prehensions underpinning conscious (vigorous) flow.

The mutual interdependence of interstice and channel mirrors Whitehead’s inseparability of what is "included" and what is "negatively prehended”. Thus, subconsciousness in FCF is not a separate realm but the persistent, measurable substrate—the dynamic “ground of possibility” against which conscious differentiation occurs.

## Phenomenological and Experimental Anchor Points

### Iconic Memory and Thresholds

Sperling's classic 1960 experiment showed that after a rapid visual exposure, observers could report only about four letters from a twelve-letter array, yet, with partial cues, could recall more—evidencing a larger, rapidly fading "iconic memory" substrate. In FCF, this reservoir is the accreting flow: information that was thermodynamically present but not integrated into working or reported (conscious) memory, filtered out by measurable thresholds—entropy (S), conceptual distance (CDA), and emotional salience (CER).

### Change Blindness

The phenomenon of **change blindness** further clarifies the boundary between conscious flow and the subconscious substrate. Even substantial changes in a scene may go unnoticed unless attention is cued or thresholds are shifted. This underscores the FCF claim: what is not consciously reported may still be present as an accreting substrate (negative prehension), available for reintegration if energetic or conceptual thresholds are crossed.

### Working Memory Constraints

The capacity limits observed in working memory align with the FCF model, where only a few patterns can achieve “vigorous flow” at any time—typically around four “chunks,” as established by Cowan and Miller. The remainder persists as accreting flow, subject to decay unless emotional or conceptual salience intervenes.

## Quantitative and Formal Principles

### The Subconscious as Accreting Flow

The FCF framework formalizes the subconscious as follows:

$$
\text{Subconscious}(t) = \int_{\text{accreting}} \left[ \sum_{\text{prehensions}^-} \right] \times \Theta(S - S_c) \times \Theta(\text{CDA} - \text{CDA}_c) \times \Theta(\text{CER}_{\text{min}} - \text{CER}) \, dP
$$

Where:

- $$
  Prehensions^- =\text { negative prehensions}
  $$

- $$
  \Theta =\text {Heaviside step function indicating passage above or below threshold}
  $$

- S, CDA, and CER represent system entropy, conceptual distance, and emotional resonance, respectively,
- Integration is over the potentia space of all configurations.

Conscious flow emerges only when these thresholds are satisfied, allowing integration. Otherwise, information lingers in the accreting substrate—a structure neither mysterious nor ontologically distinct from consciousness itself.

## Critique of Dualist and Panpsychist Models

### No “Unconscious Consciousness” Paradox

Philip Goff’s panpsychist proposal [per a substack post "[Unconscious Consciousness](https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=1652708&post_id=178516332&utm_source=post-email-title&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=6i92nz&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozOTM0NTM1MDMsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE3ODUxNjMzMiwiaWF0IjoxNzYyNzk1NTkwLCJleHAiOjE3NjUzODc1OTAsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xNjUyNzA4Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.PFaTyWy0XiHem6zKLkb5pI3Df6BZwulUSjyW6HtBDuY)", November 10th, 2025] following Ned Block, distinguishes between “phenomenal consciousness” (P-consciousness: experience without report or action) and “access consciousness” (A-consciousness: available to report/reason). Goff suggests that overflow phenomena solve the “combination problem”—the bridge between micro- and macro-consciousness. FCF rejects this split: the realities Block describes as “phenomenally conscious but inaccessible” are, functionally, accreting flows—excluded by adaptive, measurable thresholds, but always present and testable as patterns in potentia.

## Measurement Omission and Thermodynamic Concept Formation: Ayn Rand’s Contribution

Ayn Rand's theory of abstraction by 'measurement omission' provides a crucial bridge between FCF's thermodynamic framework and human conceptual cognition. However, Rand's account requires mechanistic grounding: *how* do identity boundaries stabilize such that measurement-omission becomes possible?.

Rand observed that concept formation proceeds through contrast: blue has no conceptual meaning until red is perceived; furniture distinctions emerge only when use-contexts differentiate chairs from tables. This is not merely epistemological—it is **thermodynamic**. The subconscious accreting flow provides continuous perceptual datum, creating the resistive multiplicity against which conscious vigorous flow can differentiate identity boundaries.

### **CCD as Satisficing**

Rand's Conceptual Common Denominator (CCD)—the axis along that similarities are grouped—is a satisficing operation on accreting potentia. The vigorous flow recursively contrasts accreting patterns until Affinity gradients stabilize an identity boundary ('this is a chair'). Only then can measurement-omission operate: specific dimensions (height, material, color) are excluded while relational structure ('horizontal load-bearing surface at sitting-height') persists as the conceptual essence.

### **Recursive Bootstrap**

Critically, this process is recursive. Subconscious↔conscious contrast iterates: accreting flow provides resistance, vigorous flow detects gradients, identity boundaries form, and those boundaries re-enter the accreting substrate as new baselines for higher-order abstraction. CCD thus represents the minimal threshold for L3 volitional abstraction, while FCF's Conceptual Distance Algorithm (CDA) formalizes the mechanism across all scales and substrates.

**Iteration 1:**

- Accreting: Sensory multiplicity (various objects)
- Vigorous: Attention scans (no stable pattern yet)
- Contrast: None (high entropy, S > 0.18)

**Iteration 2:**

- Accreting: Same objects, now with added context (adults enforcing use)
- Vigorous: Attention detects gradient (sit-on vs. store-in)
- Contrast: Threshold approaching (entropy begins localizing)

**Iteration 3:**

- Accreting: Objects now differentiated into "affinity clusters" (similar-use items)
- Vigorous: Identity boundary forms ("chairs" as distinct from "tables")
- Contrast: Stabilized (S < 0.18, CER > threshold, identity persistent)

**Iteration 4+:**

- Accreting: Newly stabilized identity re-enters substrate as new baseline
- Vigorous: Measurement-omission operates on established identity
- Contrast: Now available for *next-order* abstraction ("furniture" as distinct from "appliances")

This is **fractal identity differentiation**—each vigorous channel, once stabilized, becomes part of the accreting substrate for the next scale.

The FCF subconscious is therefore not an ontological void but the **thermodynamic precondition** for conceptual thought. Measurement-omission is only possible *after* accreting-flow resistances enable vigorous-flow differentiation. This dissolves the mystery of 'unconscious processing'—there is no hidden homunculus, only scale-nested flows continuously differentiating identity through thermodynamically measurable contrasts.

- **Perceptual subconscious isn't "unprocessed data"**—it's actively structured accreting flow providing contrast gradients
- **Memory subconscious isn't "forgotten content"**—it's low-CER patterns dissipating back into accreting substrate, still thermodynamically present
- **Conceptual subconscious isn't "implicit knowledge"**—it's potentia approaching but not crossing vigorous-flow thresholds



*(If you found yourself re-reading this section after encountering the contrasts, you've just experienced the mechanism it describes: accreting flow → contrast resistance → vigorous re-integration. This is not a metaphor—your cognitive process and the conceptual process it's comprehending are the same thermodynamic topology at different scales.)*

## Philosophical and Empirical Consequences

### Unified Identity Differentiation

FCF resolves the unity of consciousness without positing hidden micro-experiencers or irreducible “combination”. Identity boundaries—enforced by gradients of affinity—produce a unified conscious field by dynamically separating vigorous and accreting flows at every scale. Thus, the subconscious is not a lower layer but an inseparable complement to every conscious process, mechanized and testable.

### Mechanization of Intuition and Integration

What we call intuition—sudden insights, “gut feelings,” premonitions—is the result of patterns in the accreting flow approaching thresholds for conscious integration. This process is as present in phase transitions in physical systems (ice “sensing” an approaching melt) as it is in conscious beings adapting to social or experiential novelty.

## Conclusion

The FCF theory situates the subconscious as the dynamically accreting flow of negative prehensions, measurable and always entwined with conscious experience. This perspective is rigorously anchored in the mechanisms of process philosophy, constructal law, cognitive psychology, and modern thermodynamics. It rejects the dualisms of both classical psychology (“repressed unconscious”) and contemporary panpsychism (“overflowing phenomenal consciousness”) in favor of a topology where accreting and vigorous flows ceaselessly differentiate, integrate, and shape identity at every scale.
